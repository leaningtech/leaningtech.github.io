## Leaning Technologies own Jekyll theme

To set up a GitHub page using the same theme, you should:
* copy to_be_modified/\_config.yml to the top level of your own repo
* modify the appropriate fields of the new \_config.yml file
* copy 404.md to the top level of your own repo
* copy about.md to the top level of your own repo, and modify it appropriately
* create the folder \_includes at the top level of your own repo
* copy \_includes/index.hmtl inside the \_includes folder and modify it appropriately
* commit everything
* enable publishing to GitHub pages on the setting for your own repo

Now if all went well, you should have a new and stilish GitHub page for the project
