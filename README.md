We bring your software to the browser. Compiled automatically, executed efficiently, fully client-side. Our team of WebAssembly experts is ready to help you with your project.

We are a computer software company based out of Leeds, UK and Amsterdam, Netherlands. We specialise in WebAssembly and compile-to-JavaScript solutions to convert applications into Web Apps.

Our tools allow companies to preserve critical legacy applications written in Java, Flash and C/C++, and automatically migrate them to HTML5 and WebAssembly, making their application accessible from any modern browser.

Our solutions have given organisations an alternative option to rewriting native applications to HTML5/JavaScript. They keep a single code base, which avoids bug duplication, as you are reusing your existing code. This allows you to continue to leverage your existing team skills, and most of all, saving you the time, effort and budget needed to hire a new team.
